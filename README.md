# Hey there!

I'm **Marcelo Vazquez (Canti)**. I thrive creating systems and software. Here you can find some projects i've worked on. I like to try new things all the time, so this page acts as a portfolio of my evolution as a developer. From basic web pages to full apps in various languages such as Concurrent Java programs, simple AI and numeric methods using Python, etc.

Feel free to check out my repos.
